Filled with graffiti art, graphic displays of life itself, and black-and-white caricatures of Indigenous tribe markings and bowls, it truly encapsulated the raw emotion that I came to associate with the COVID-19 pandemic. There, we found countless murals with messages dating back to last February, when the quarantines and endless isolation first began. We (my roommates and I) only went to this art exhibit late at night - it felt more personal that way -  but it seemed to burst and glisten with life even in the absence of other spectators. To me, it depicted the ""what ifs"" and ""could have beens"" of 2020, but it was most importantly a graphical representation of the sheer unlikelihood of all the random events that led to finding this strange collection of art under a random bridge in the desert. Who could have expected that the combination of a global pandemic, cheap Airbnb prices, and a ragtag group of desperate college students would lead to spontaneously moving to New Mexico during Fall Term. This pandemic has definitely been horrid - the amount of pain, suffering, and desperation spawning from the hell that is COVID-19 is absolutely immeasurable. But, I do think there is at least a modicum of benefit from finally being able to take a step back, take a deep breath, and finally get to adventure underneath a few bridges or two.
